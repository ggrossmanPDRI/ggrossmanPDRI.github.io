I am a professor at the [political science department](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/polisci/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/). My research is in applied political economy, with a substantive focus on governance, migration and forced displacement, human trafficking, and conflict processes, (mostly) in the context of developing countries.

I am the founder and co-director of Penn’s Development Research Initiative (PDRI-DevLab). Launched in 2020, [PDRI-DevLab](https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/) brings together faculty and graduate students from across Penn whose research seeks to identify solutions to the challenges facing low- and middle-income countries. PDRI seeks to foster impactful international development research by harnessing the expertise of its affiliates from various disciplines and utilizing diverse methodological approaches.

At Penn, I am also a Faculty Affiliate at The Center for the Study of Ethnicity, Race, and Immigration Study ([CSERI](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/cseri/)), a member of Wharton’s [Lauder](https://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/) Graduate Group in International Studies, and an advisory board member of the [Penn Center for Social Norms and Behavioral Dynamics](https://normsandbehavior.sas.upenn.edu/). More broadly, I am a member of the Evidence in Governance and Politics ([EGAP](https://egap.org/)) network, a Faculty Affiliate of Stanford’s Immigration Policy Lab ([IPL](https://immigrationlab.org/)), and a Faculty Associate at Princeton’s Empirical Studies of Conflict ([ESOC](https://esoc.princeton.edu/)). 

My work has appeared in Science magazine, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Science Advances, the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, International Organization, and the Journal of Politics, among other journals. I hold a PhD in Political Science from Columbia University (2011, with distinction) as well as MA in Political Philosophy (2004, Summa cum laude) and LLB in Law (1999, Magna cum laude) both from Tel-Aviv University.
