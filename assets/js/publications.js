      abstract: "This study analyzes the evolution of political science (PS) scholarship using 140,000+ articles from 174 journals (2003–2023). We examine how structural changes—shrinking job markets and increased reliance on publication metrics—affect what gets studied and how. Growing publication pressures push younger scholars to publish more, yet the tripling of PS publication volume stems from a larger contributor base, not individual output. On a positive note, structural shifts have made PS more collaborative, with efficiency gains from team research outweighing credit diffusion. Contrary to fears of topical narrowing, our text-as-data analysis shows consistent topical diversity, though higher-ranked journals form a distinct ecosystem with unique methodological references.",

We highlight a core paradox widespread public concern often coexists with limited climate literacy—suggesting that political salience stems from lived experience with environmental disruption rather than scientific attribution.",

We argue that ethnic minority immigrants winning political office makes natives feel threatened, triggering animosity. We test this dynamic across the 2010–2019 UK general elections, using hate crime police records, public opinion data, and text data from over 500,000 regional and local newspaper articles. While past work has not established a causal relationship between minorities' political power gains and dominant-group animosity, we identify natives' hostile reactions with a regression discontinuity design that leverages close election results between immigrant-origin ethnic minority and dominant-group candidates. We find that minority victories increase hate crimes by 67%, exclusionary attitudes by 66%, and negative media coverage of immigrant groups by 110%. Consistent with power threat and social identity theories, these findings demonstrate a strong and widespread negative reaction—encompassing a violence-prone fringe and the mass public—against ethnic minority immigrants' integration into majority settings.",

While research on the resource curse has debated the effects of oil on governance and conflict, less is known about the political effects of oil discoveries absent production. Using comprehensive electoral data from Uganda and a difference-in-difference design with heterogeneous effects, we show that oil discoveries increased electoral support for the incumbent chief executive in localities proximate to discoveries, even prior to production. Moreover, the biggest effects occurred in localities that were historically most electorally competitive. Overall, we show that the political effects of oil discoveries vary subnationally depending on local political context and prior to production, with important implications for understanding the roots of the political and conflict curses.

    abstract: "Young citizens in many democracies, and more so in electoral autocracies, turn out to vote at relatively low rates. Low youth participation arguably contributes to political parties' tendency to de-prioritize the youth's policy preferences. We analyze the effect of three low-cost, scalable, theoretically-grounded, online interventions designed to encourage young Moroccans to turn out and cast an informed vote ahead of the 2021 parliamentary elections. Those interventions aimed at (1) lowering the cost of participation by providing information about the voting registration process, (2) increasing the expected benefit of voting by providing information about the stakes of the election, and about (3) the distance between respondents’ policy preferences and political parties' policy platforms. We find that while all three interventions failed to increase youth turnout on average, the two treatments designed to increase expected benefits increased turnout intentions for likely 'compliers' those who, prior to treatment assignment, were unsure about whether to vote. Moreover, providing information about parties' policy platforms durably increased their support for the party that best represented their preferences, ultimately leading to better-informed voting. Consistent with probabilistic voting models with voting costs, the effect of the party-platforms treatment is concentrated among those who rated the party that our treatment deemed most congruent from a policy perspective as one of their two favorite parties. Contributing to information processing theories, we also find that party updating followed a form of motivated reasoning even in a context with weak party institutionalization.",

It is however unclear whether the threat of infection triggers violence in addition to stigmatization, and whether a violent reaction can happen at the onset of an unexpected economic shock before social hierarchies can be disrupted. Using a novel database of hate crimes across Italy, we show that (i) hate crimes against Asians increased substantially at the pandemic onset, and that (ii) the increase was concentrated in cities with higher expected unemployment, but not higher mortality. We then examine individual, local and national mobilization as mechanisms. We find that (iii) a xenophobic national discourse and local far-right institutions motivate hate crimes, while we find no support for the role of individual prejudice. Our study identifies new conditions triggering hateful behavior, advancing our understanding of factors hindering migrant integration. ",

    abstract: "Large arrivals of refugees raise concerns about potential tensions with host communities, particularly if refugees are viewed as an out-group competing for limited material resources and crowding out public services. To address these concerns, calls have increased to allocate humanitarian aid in ways that also benefit host communities. This study tests whether the increased presence of refugees, when coupled with humanitarian aid, improves public service delivery for host communities and dampens potential social conflict. We study this question in Uganda, one of the largest and most inclusive refugee-hosting countries. The data combines geospatial information on refugee settlements with original longitudinal data on primary and secondary schools, road density, health clinics, and health utilization. We report two key findings. First, even after the 2014 arrival of over 1 million South Sudanese refugees, host communities with greater refugee presence experienced substantial improvements in local development. Second, using public opinion data, we find no evidence that refugee presence has been associated with more negative (or positive) attitudes towards migrants or migration policy.",

Whether consumers discount slanted media coverage is a question gaining urgency as a growing number of billionaires mix ownership of major media outlets with business interests and political agendas. We study this question in the context of Israel, where billionaire Sheldon Adelson launched in 2007 Israel Hayom, a right-leaning newspaper. Handed out for free, it soon became the most widely read newspaper nationally. Using local media exposure data since the launch, our analysis indicates that the newspaper exerted significant electoral influence, primarily benefiting Netanyahu and his Likud party. This shift helped bring about a sea change in the right’s dominance of national politics. The findings highlight the immense impact the ultrarich can exert in shaping politics through media ownership.",

We review the current literature on government responsiveness, with a focus on public goods and service delivery in developing countries. We identify three types of actors that are commonly present in these accounts: politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens. Much of this literature examines interactions between dyads of these actors. The study of electoral accountability and constituency services emphasizes relationships between citizens (or voters) and politicians. Studies of bureaucratic incentives and political oversight of bureaucrats emphasize interactions between politicians and bureaucrats. Finally, studies of bureaucratic embeddedness and citizen oversight of bureaucrats elaborate the interactions between bureaucrats and citizens. We argue that an emerging literature that considers interactions between all three types of actors provides rich theoretical and empirical terrain for developing our understanding of responsiveness and accountability in low- and middle-income countries and beyond.",

Although extensive research has examined the question of who votes, our understanding of the determinants of political participation will be limited until we know who is missing from the voter register. Studying voter registration in lower-income settings is particularly challenging due to data constraints. We link the official voter register with a complete social network census of 16 villages to analyze the correlates of voter registration in rural Uganda, examining the role of individual-level attributes and social ties. We find evidence that social ties are important for explaining registration status within and across households. Village leaders—and through them, household heads—play an important role in explaining the registration status of others in the village, suggesting a diffuse process of social influence. Socioeconomic factors such as income and education do not explain registration in this setting. Together these findings suggest an alternate theory of participation is required.",

    abstract: "Most forced migrants around the world are displaced within the Global South. We study whether and how de jure policies on forced displacement affect where forced migrants flee in the developing world. Recent evidence from the Global North suggests migrants gravitate toward liberal policy environments. However, existing analyses expect de jure policies to have little effect in the developing world, given strong presumptions that policy enforcement is poor and policy knowledge is low. Using original data on de jure displacement policies for 92 developing countries and interviews with 126 refugees and policy makers, we document a robust association between liberal de jure policies and forced migrant flows. Gravitation toward liberal environments is conditional on factors that facilitate the diffusion of policy knowledge, such as transnational ethnic kin. Policies for free movement, services, and livelihoods are especially attractive. Utility-maximizing models of migrant decision making must take de jure policy provisions into account.",

    abstract: "Incumbents often seek to wield power in ways that are formally legal but informally proscribed. Why do voters endorse these power grabs? Prior literature focuses on polarization. We propose instead that many voters are majoritarian, in that they view popularly elected leaders’ actions as inherently democratic – even when those actions undermine liberal democracy. We find support for this claim in two original survey experiments, arguing that majoritarians’ desire to give wide latitude to elected officials is an important but understudied threat to liberal democracy in the United States.",

    abstract: "Little theoretical or empirical work examines migration policy in the developing world. We develop and test a theory that distinguishes the drivers of policy reform and factors influencing the direction of reform. We introduce an original data set of de jure asylum and refugee policies covering more than ninety developing countries that are presently excluded from existing indices of migration policy. Examining descriptive trends in the data, we find that unlike in the global North, forced displacement policies in the global South have become more liberal over time. Empirically, we test the determinants of asylum policymaking, bolstering our quantitative results with qualitative evidence from interviews in Uganda. A number of key findings emerge. Intense, proximate civil wars are the primary impetus for asylum policy change in the global South. Liberalizing changes are made by regimes led by political elites whose ethnic kin confront discrimination or violence in neighboring countries. There is no generalizable evidence that developing countries liberalize asylum policy in exchange for economic assistance from Western actors. Distinct frameworks are needed to understand migration policymaking in developing versus developed countries.",

We use an endorsement experiment embedded in a mobile phone survey to show that messages from government officials generate more support for public health restrictions than messages from religious authorities, traditional leaders, or international NGOs. We further show that compliance with these restrictions is strongly positively correlated with trust in government, but only weakly correlated with trust in local authorities or other citizens. We use measures of trust from both before and during the pandemic to rule out the possibility that trust is a function of the pandemic itself. The relationship between trust and compliance is especially strong for the Ministry of Health and—more surprisingly—the police. We conclude that trust is crucial for encouraging compliance but note that it may be difficult to sustain, particularly in settings where governments and police forces have reputations for repression.",

How do social ties between individuals shape equilibrium behavior in larger populations? Despite theoretical inroads into this question, direct empirical tests remain scarce due to data limitations. We fill this gap using full social network data from 15 villages in rural Uganda, where village-level turnout is the outcome of interest. We find that levels of participation predicted by structural features of village networks are strongly associated with actual village-level turnout in low-salience local elections, and weakly associated in high-salience presidential elections. We also find that these features predict other forms of political participation, including attending village meetings and contributing to village projects. In addition to demonstrating that networks help explain political participation, we provide evidence that the mechanism of influence is that proposed by social context theory rather than alternative mechanisms like the presence of central brokers or the ability of networks to diffuse information.",

Yet there are minorities, ranging from 10 to 35 percent of the population, who support efforts to erode democracy.

Community policing is a celebrated reform with that aim, which is now adopted on six continents. However, the evidence base is limited, studying reform components in isolation in a limited set of countries, and remaining largely silent on citizen-police trust. We designed six field experiments with Global South police agencies to study locally designed models of community policing using coordinated measures of crime and the attitudes and behaviors of citizens and police. In a preregistered meta-analysis, we found that these interventions led to mixed implementation, largely failed to improve citizen-police relations, and did not reduce crime. Societies may need to implement structural changes first for incremental police reforms such as community policing to succeed",

We implemented a nationwide experiment in Uganda following a smaller-scale framed field experiment that suggested that ICTs can lead to significant “flattening”: marginalized populations used short message service (SMS) based communication at relatively higher rates compared to existing political communication channels. We find no evidence for these effects in the national experiment. Instead, participation rates are extremely low, and marginalized populations engage at especially low rates. We examine possible reasons for these differences between the more controlled and the scaled-up experiments. The evidence suggests that even when citizens have issues they want to raise, technological fixes to communication deficits can be easily undercut by structural weaknesses in political systems.",

Identifying the drivers of political action is challenging because it requires disentangling instrumental from expressive motives for engagement and because government responsiveness is likely endogenous. We overcome the first challenge by studying citizens’ reporting of street-problems—a form of participation arguably driven by instrumental considerations. We overcome the second challenge by taking advantage of variation in local elections timing in England’s district authorities. We report three key results. First, local governments address requests faster in the months leading to elections. Second, street-problem reporting increases in (pre)electoral periods. Third, the increase in requests sent in preelection periods is driven by districts in which government responsiveness is higher. These findings show that, individuals consider expected benefits when choosing to undertake at least some instrumental forms of participation. Our results also underscore the importance of temporal factors that increase the perceived benefits of one’s political engagement.",

But evidence on the effectiveness of COP is surprisingly scant. We present results from one of the first randomized controlled trials to evaluate the impact of COP in the Global South. The COP initiative we study was locally designed and funded by the Ugandan government. Contrary to our expectations, we find no evidence that the program reduced crime, enhanced citizens’ perceptions of safety, improved their attitudes towards the police, increased crime reporting, or strengthened other norms of citizen cooperation with the police.   Nor do we find evidence that the program generated greater empathy or accountability among participating police officers themselves. We explore a variety of potential explanations for these null results, including both supply-side factors (e.g., resource constraints within the Ugandan police force) and demand-side factors (e.g., citizens’ fear of engaging with the police). We find no evidence that overcoming these obstacles would make COP more effective.  Taken together, our findings point to potential limitations of COP in low-income countries.",

      abstract: "Research has documented the importance of teamwork in the form of co-authorship for research productivity and innovation, but we know much less about how informal collaborations relate to academic success. Informal ties allow intangible exchanges like mentoring, guidance, and feedback to flow among scholars: these interactions weave a support structure that improves ideas and encourages project growth. However, these informal exchanges are more difficult to measure because they do not leave as clear a trail as co-authorship ties. Here, we uncover this layer of informal communication around scholarly outputs by parsing the information contained in the acknowledgment sections of published articles. Our data include 130,000 articles authored by 86,000 scholars from the period 2003-2023. We analyze scholars’ embeddedness in this informal structure of collaboration and reveal that (1) informal ties create a larger and denser network of support than co-authorship ties; (2) disconnection from informal networks is associated with gaps in productivity and impact; and (3) informal ties are a more relevant predictor of academic success than formal collaborations, even after matching for gender, seniority, methodology, and geographical location. Using coarsened exact matching and random forest regressions we show that informal structures of support are significantly associated with academic impact, creating gaps in who benefits from those connections.

      abstract: "This study examines how college students navigate the tension between free speech and harm prevention, highlighted by recent campus protests around the war in Gaza. Using online survey experiments with 3,065 college students nationwide, we find that the severity of speech and the target’s identity strongly influence support for disciplinary actions in response to objectionable speech. Students generally oppose punishing objectionable speech unless it is deemed highly harmful. Hateful rhetoric targeting minority groups, such as Black, Jewish, Muslim, and transgender individuals, elicits stronger punitive responses than identical statements directed at White students. While students, on average, afford greater protections to minority groups, there is notable variation. Exploratory analysis reveals that students’ responses are shaped by normative principles: about two-thirds believe minority groups should receive greater protection from harmful speech, while one-third advocate universal, equal treatment regardless of the target’s identity. These principles predict responses to speech scenarios, beyond ideology, stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and other personal characteristics. However, commitment to these principles weakens when individuals have a strong stance on the topic. These findings shed light on how college students balance competing principles of fairness and harm prevention in polarized contexts, offering insights into contemporary campus debates about free speech and inclusion.",

However, it is unclear whether this is due to intrinsic motivations or electoral incentives. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to analyze ethnic minority representation in the UK Parliament. By comparing white MPs who narrowly beat minority candidates to minority MPs who narrowly beat white candidates, the RDD controls for electoral incentives since it holds constant constituency factors correlated with a minority parliamentary win. Analyzing over 1 million parliamentary questions and speeches, we find that minority MPs are more likely than white MPs to discuss issues important to ethnic minorities. Additional evidence supports that narrowly elected MPs face similar electoral incentives, and that minority MPs representing minorities face reelection penalties. Our findings suggest that minority substantive representation is driven at least in part by intrinsic motivations.",

We address this question by using a large language model to classify 91,632 articles published between 2003 and 2023 across 174 political science journals, focusing on causal research designs, transparency practices, and citation patterns. Design-based studies—research strategies that explicitly a research design and the assumptions required for causal identification—have become increasingly common, displacing regression-based analyses that rely primarily on modeling assumptions. Yet as of 2023, studies without an explicit identification strategy still constitute nearly 40% of empirical quantitative work. Within design-based research, survey experiments dominate, while field experiments and quasi-experimental approaches have grown more modestly. Transparency practices such as placebo tests and power analysis remain rare. Design-based studies are concentrated in top journals and among authors at highly ranked institutions, and enjoy a persistent citation premium. The credibility revolution has meaningfully reshaped the discipline, though unevenly and incompletely",

      abstract: "Inclusive refugee policies -- granting refugees the right to work, use public services, and move freely -- benefit both refugees and host countries' economies. Yet many governments hesitate to liberalize such policies, fearing electoral backlash. Can governments minimize backlash by pairing expansions of refugee rights with policies that reduce burdens on host communities? We examine this question in Uganda, Africa's largest refugee hosting country. Alongside refugee policy liberalization, Uganda mandated reallocating a share of refugee aid to communities near refugee centers. Combining refugee settlement data with election returns (2001--2021) and a generalized difference-in-differences design, we show first that the vote share of the incumbent president was significantly lower in areas with high refugee presence before the 2010 reforms. Afterwards, a one standard deviation increase in refugee presence was associated with a four percentage point increase in the vote share of the incumbent government. Using public goods data, public opinion surveys, newspaper data, and parliamentary speech records, we find that infrastructure investments in hosting communities and the reluctance of opposition parties to rally against popular policies account for our findings.",
